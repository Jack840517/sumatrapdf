A daily log of changes and commentary. An experiment of sorts.

2021-12-23 Fri
- update mupdf (fixes #2268)
  fixes https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2268
  i.e. repairs outline to load it
  unfortunately it marks the file as having unsaved annotations

2021-12-14 Tue
- update mupdf

2021-12-08 Wed
- respect DiskAccess=0 better (fixes #2263)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2263
  Also shortened some loops since for (x : a) works on static arrays
- optimize layout of PageInfo, ScrollState and DisplayModel thanks to SizeBench
  Using https://devblogs.microsoft.com/performance-diagnostics/sizebench-a-new-tool-for-analyzing-windows-binary-size/
  It's kind of piece of shit but butter than nothing

2021-12-03 Fri
- add 'Delete Annotation' context menu and Del / Backspace (fixes #2248)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2248
- fix deleting annotations (fixes #2249)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2249
  a mismatch between Annotation* kept in EditAnnotationsWindow
  and Annotation* from outside.

2021-12-02 Thu

- fix management of tooltips for tags (fixes #2247)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2247
  still not a great solution. This information should be stored
  on TabsInfo and TabsCtrl2 should only manage ITab objects that
  provide needed info

- strip 'mailto:' when copying links to clipboard (fixes #2244)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2244

2021-11-05 Fri

- take access lock in GetToc() (fixes #2229)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2229
  there might be more locking lacking

- add Shift-F12 shorcut to toggle bookmarks (in addition to F12)
  This is for use under Visual Studio. F12 triggers a breakpoint,
  which is annoying

- hide cursor immediately on F5 and fix cursor hiding regression (fixes #2231)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2231
  There was a regression in 3.3 where the cursor in F5 (full-screen) was not auto-hidden
  the second time
  There was also an issue (probably always present) that hiding a cursor in
  EnterFullScreen() was a no-op because would get over-ridden by OnMouseMove()
  which is triggered after entering full-screen (which makes sense because it
  re-positiones a window and therefore mouse position changes)

- restore multi-frame images (tif and gif) (fixes #2234)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2234

- fix tooltips to always show the right text (fixes #2233)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2233
  turns out TTM_NEWTOOLRECT doesn't change the text shown by tooltip
  so we remember what we show and if it changes, we TTM_DELTOOL
  and then TTM_ADDTOOL it. There might be a simpler way
  (TTM_GETTOOLINFO followed by TTM_SETTOOLINFO?)

2021-10-26 Tue

- fix pdf_resolve_link (fixes #2216)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2216

2021-10-25 Mon

- if fails to open with engine mupdf, also try to open with other engines (fixes #2212)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2212

2021-10-22 Fri

- fix generating corrupted PDF when doing 'save to new pdf' twice (fixes #2206)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2206
  was doing something that wasn't supported by mupdf

- re-enable opening fb2 inside .zip and support .fbz extension (fixes #870, fixes #2147)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/870
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2147

- don't show favorites when reloading prefs (fixes #2145)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2145
  still not perfect: we don't save preferences after changing state of showing favorites

- swap keyboard shortcuts 'i' and 'shift - i' (fixes #2210)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2210

- better handle URLs in EngineMupdf

2021-10-20 Wed

- fixed storing navigation change twice on tree item click (fixes #2202)
  removed TocTreeClick handler because it duplicates the work
  of selection changed handler
- fix crash 'save as' for .zip / .cbx files (fixes #2198)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2198
  There were 2 problems. OnMenuSaveAs() didn't handle defExt being null
  defaultExt for EngineCbx was null because defaultExt field
  was hiding one in EngineBase. 

2021-10-17 Sun

- add 'u' for underline annotation; add Annotations.underlineColor setting (fixes #2157)
- don't crash on empty links in djvu (fixes #2200)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2200

2021-10-15 Fri

- support .heic files (fixes #2196)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2196

2021-10-04 Mon

- update mupdf

2021-09-29 Wed

- Revert "lazy calculation of page dimensions in DisplayModel"
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/9598d5fdff035493c8054139eb4936f3ee00f181
  lesson: should have tested bigger changes like that
- don't crash in NormalizeWSInPlace if null string
  seen in crash reports

2021-09-23 Thu

- implement 'search' cmd-line flag (fixes #2167)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2167
  turned out to be quite simple

2021-09-14 Tue

- fix external viewers for file paths with space in them (fixes #2163)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2163
  was caused by refactoring

2021-09-12 Sun

2021-08-30 Mon

- refactor printing a bit

2021-08-27 Fri

- change MultiFormatArchive::OpenUnrarFallback to use RAR_OM_LIST instead of RAR_OM_EXTRACT (seems faster)
- less using Gdiplus::

2021-08-26 Thu

- add 'Cancel' button to unsaved annotations confirmation dialog (fixes #2119)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2119
- de-bounce re-rendering of document for 1 sec after changing contents of an annotation (fixes #2034)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2034

2021-08-17 Tue

- re-enable 'Open Embedded File' via context menu on table of contents tree view (fixes #2122)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2122
  should test with more files
- simplify Calc[MD5|Sha1|Sha2]DigestWin by re-using common code
- remove redundant md5/sha1/sha2 implementations using libmupdf
- remove NO_LIBMUPDF, move FzImgReader.[cpp|h] out of src/utils => src/

2021-08-11 Wed

- properly manage visibility state of favortis after adding / removing items (fixes #2120)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2120

2021-08-04 Wed

- fix djvu links going to page + 1 (fixes #2097)

2021-08-03 Tue

- possibly fix PdfPreview handler (for #2080)
  When extending EngineMupdf to handle more file types I broke
  loading with IStream because previously, it was always a pdf
  and now we need to tell which kind of file we're loading
  by either mimetype or file extension
  the fix is to propagate a dummy name that indicates file type
- don't trigger debug crash rebuilding annotations in non-pdf documents (fixes #2090)
  still don't get why I wasn't getting those crashes in debug builds
  (so I couldn't reproduce them)
- compile extract becase mupdf made it non-optional

2021-08-02 Mon

2021-07-31 Sat

- convert PageLayoutType into struct PageLayout
- fix the logic to expand first item in toc tree if at most 2 top-level nodes
  was broken during TreeModel refactor
- support .txt files in EngineMupdf
- add displayDPI to EngineMupdf
- improve handling of annotations (as prompted by #1517)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1517
  I think the issue in the latest comment with PDF generated
  by overleaf is that there are PDF_ANNOT_SCREEN annotations
  that are not handled by mupdf (it prints
  "cannot create appearance stream for Screen annotations" message).
  they are shown by pdf.js so possibly valid

2021-07-30 Fri

- fix links in EngineMupfd (fixes #2074)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2074
  a regression from previous rewrite
  should have tested it more
- change the start directory from System32 to Documents (fixes #2073)
- fix crash in NewChmTocItem() (fixes #2075)
  silly typo, should have tested
- fix threading issue in how mupdf uses harfbuzz (fixes #2077)
  they store mupdf context in a global fz_hb_secret, which gets
  set during html layout in html_layout.c. They have locking
  around it which works as long as all threads share ctx and their
  locks. It doesn't work when multiple threads use different
  fz_context (in Sumatra: opening multiple epub files at the same time)
- change EngineBase::GetElements() to return Vec<> instead of Vec<>*
- don't leak in EngineDjVu::GetElements()
- set defaultExt in EngineMupdf based on opened file
- don't leak in EngineImages::GetElemens()
- restore opening of file:// links in PDF files

2021-07-29 Thu

- don't pass Controller* to HandleLink()
- progress on IPageElement refactor
- remove EngineXps and use EngineMupdf for .xps files
- merge EngineFzUtil.cpp into EngineMupdf.cpp
- remove IPageElement::Clone() and change GetElementAtPos() and GetElements() to return objects that don't require deleting

2021-07-27 Tue

- update mupdf
- make EngineMupdf accept .epub et al, delete EngineMupdf
- naming cleanups in EnginePdf
- rename EnginePdf = > EngineMupdf; enable opening HTML with EngineMupdf
- support .svg files via EngineMupdf
- move PalmDbReader.[cpp|h] from src/utils/ => src/
- working on link handling refactor

2021-07-25 Sun

- rework StrFormat.cpp to be smaller
- fix crash regression in reloading 'r' (fixes #2055)
- use RemoveBadMenuSeparators() in TocContextMenu()
- add website-api
- fixed PoolAllocator when allocating large chunks (fixes #2056)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2056
  needs unit tests for PoolAllocator

- fix PalmDoc overwrite of WStrVec allocator in debug build (fixes #2057)
I think str::Str was compiled in DEBUG but EbookDoc.cpp in release
and there was a mismatch between what the layout of str::Str in PalmDoc struct
was vs. what the code in str::Str thought it was. str::Str has nRealloc
variable which was within #if defined(DEBUG) but due to mismatch shared memory
with the first word of the next object, which happened to be WStrVec::allocator.
Changing nRealloc would over-write allocator, leading to crashes.

2021-07-23 Fri

- make temp allocator be per-thread. the only sane thing to do
- fix toc tree on all document types
- convert typedef std::function to using
- tweak build script
- add -file-upload and -files-list
- use zlib-ng instead of zlib for faster .zip decompression

2021-07-21 Wed

- update mupdf
- fix handling of links (fixes #2039)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2039
  didn't notice this in code review

- redo 'Save annotations' dialog with TaskDialog; replace CrashIf() with ReportIf()
- installer: actually copy the files to installation dir
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2040
  stupidly removed code when fixing -x extraction
  should review code more carefully
- for pre-release, only do auto-update check every 1 week

- fix regression in win::GetTextTemp() which would cut last char (fixes #2038)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2038
  a case where should have double-checked after changing what looked like incorrect code
  (but was correct)

- pack translation info into TranslationCache
- optimize translation cache
- redo auto-update code to work for portable versions
- fix -x to respect extraction directory when -install wasn't also given

2021-07-18 Sun

- add -delete-file arg; sketch CmdLineCmdLineArgsIter; add logging to -x installer option
- fix potential corruption in str::ReplacePtr() and str::ReplaceWithCopy()
- IPageElment::GetPageNo() is an optional page fo rthe destination, not page on which it is
  was causing debug crashes because I assumed it was a valid page number
  and probably was causing tooltips to not show up properly
- don't try to access favorites menus if they were removed due to lack of prefs or disk access
  seen debug crashes from win::menu::SetText() for non-existent menu items
- better way of removing bad menu separators

  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2033
  A typo when refactoring ToCodePage function when allocated buffer
  for the right code page but tried to convert to utf8, sizes mismatched
  thankfully had debug assert to catch this
- restore showing toc tree for chm files
  a typo from refactoring toc generation; flipped condition for detecting
  toc exists or not
- hopefully fix invalid pageNo in newFzLink (for #2035)
  don't send crash reports from debug builds

  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2018
- save scroll position in settings as float, not int (fixes #2017)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/2017
  Regression from https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1752

- fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1970
  a crash when pressing 'q' on empty window. a regression from
  recent change.
  lesson: more testing even when making seemingly simple changes
- updates keyboard shortcuts docs, formatted .html files with prettier
  (will be easier to review diffs after notion import in the future).
- optimized TocItem::ChildAt() for https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1795#issuecomment-855295881
  this document is somewhat of an edge case in that it has toc items with
  lots of children and ChildAt(n) would always traverse from first child,
  creating a quadratic time complexity.
  still not fast enough for this particular document but at least now
  the time is spent fully in windows TreeCtrl code.
- website: make display of keyboard shortcut in manual.html look closer to docs/Keyboard-shortcuts.html
- speedup PopulateTreeItem (fixes #1795)
  https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1795
  the trick was to insert children in reverse order, as per
  https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20111125-00/?p=9033
- speed up TreeCtrl::GetTreeItemByHandle()
- speed up TreeCtrl::GetHandleByTreeItem() by storing handle in TreeItem
- website: fix broken links
- possibly speed up Vec::EnsureCap()
- disable TocEditor, New Bookmarks etc.

- replace NotificationGroupId with Kind
- convert enum NotificationOptions to enum class

2021-05-29 Sat

- Refactor StressTest: convert most method to functions.
- Remove ImgFormat because it's redundant with kindFile*
- Tweak detection of clang-format.exe and msbuild.exe so that
 we consistently start with 2019 Preview.
- stress testing: limit number of rendered pages per file to 32 randomly
  picked pages. This speeds up stress testing by avoiding rendering really
  big documents. 

2021-05-28 Fri

- In 3.2 I introduced a regression: when user changed pages I tried to sync
  the treeview selection to match the current page. In 3.1.2 we would limit
  auto-select to currently expanded items. In 3.2 we would auto-expand
  tree item to make selected tree item visible.
  Fixed it in https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/4960ce53950bd9d50500c4141b41b7d4839dc767

The TreeCtrl / TreeModel still has problems.

1. To make things efficient TreeItem shouldn't be a class but an
opaque pointer-sized handle and it's items should belong to
TreeModel. This would allow us to potentially optimize how we store
information. Currently we have to create TreeItem object for
every node.

2. Changes to TreeCtrl are not reflected in TreeModel. Maybe
they shouldn't but then we should be more clear about it
in the code.

Folded premake5.opt.lua into premake5.lua. When changing flags
in premake5.lua I would always forget to update premake5.opt.lue
Now relevant projects are close together and in the same file
so maybe less mistakes in the future.

---

On a treemodel branch, redid TreeModel interface, by folding TreeItem
methods into it. This is to open possibility for more efficient implementation
of TreeModel. Even now the code should be a bit smaller by removing methods
from what were TreeItem subclasses.

Links to /settings3.3.html and /settings/settings3.3.html were broken because
Cloudflare Pages doesn't handle HTML files with '.' in the name.
Had to change naming scheme to /settings/settings3-3.html

---

Fixed Notion HTML generation to not generate files with '.' in them.

2021-05-27 Thu

Added support for .xps files with jpeg-xr images in them.
mupdf has code that uses open-source jpeg-xr library but we used
to have decoder that used Windows built-in codec. This got lost
during the big mupdf merge.
I resurrected this code and tweak it a bit.

Fixed building on GitHub Actions caused by msbuild changes in
Visual Studio 2019 Preview.
In the past "msbuild /t:test_util" worked just fine.
In latest it has to be "msbuild /t:test_util:Rebuild".
No idea why ":Rebuild" (also tried just ":Build" but it didn't work).

ixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1286
'i' would show page number only temporarily (persistently with SHIFT)
and only in full screen.
Make it work always and toggle the info.
It could be improved (no close button, don't dismiss with ESC like
other notification windows, no flickering of notification window).

fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1711
(and https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1454 most likely).
When the cache of rendered pages is full, we free a page. If we happened to
free a page from the document in the current tab, it would lead to free / re-rerender
cycle and flickering.
The fix is to make sure we only free from other tabs.
Not perfect (if it's a visible tab in a different window, we'll probably flicker).
The right approach would be to make the cache expand in FreeIfFull()
if we can't find invisible page to drop (e.g. by using linked list
to store cache entries or by having e.g. 256 over-flow entries).

fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1712
Lots of debugging but the root cause was simple: notifications window
is a child of canvas window. it was flickering because a paint of
canvas would paint over notification window.
Fixed by telling canvas window to clip children.
We should make it more flexible and more efficient to add stuff to be
drawn on canvas.

handle pdf_annot_author() throwing (fixes #1673)

don't crash when trying to restore deleted file (fixes #1674)
it was a regression from the fix for saving preferences.
probably not the best fix, should fix the fact that prefs::Save()
deletes gGlobalPrefs->sessionData while 're iterating on it

- limit which annotations can be moved
- refactor dragging logic a bit
- make ESC cancel dragging of an annotation
- show rect of selected annotation in annotation editor

2020-07-09 Thu

- fix regression of not copying rectangular selection as image (fixes #1668)
- write DisplayModel::GetAnnotationAtPos(Point) and EngineGetAnnotationAtPos(Engine, Point)
- update annotation rect after it's moved

2020-07-08 Wed

Parallelized doit -clang-format. Go concurrency is a joy.

implement EngineMupdfHasUnsavedAnnotations() and bug-fix detection
of when to show 'Save PDF' button in annotations editor.

update mupdf.
this was a big one because mupdf switched to using gumbo
as html/xml parser.

- tweak premake definitions
- ask to save unsaved annotation when closing a pdf file

2020-07-07 Tue

Added creation of highlight, squiggly, strikeout and underline
annotations.

Replaced EngineMupdf::IsLinearizedFile() with mupdf's pdf_doc_was_linearized.
It didn't exist when IsLinearizedFile() was written.
Removing code feels good.

2020-07-06 Mon

Fixed a bunch of issues related to bugs in freetype and not
compiling Sumatra with the exact same freetype options as mupdf.
Introduced when I updated freetype code.

Removed .smx support. It's a lot of work to add support for all
PDF annotations (for each annotation type need to write code
to serialize it, de-serialize it, draw the annotation for
each engine type).
It's also sumatra-only and I suppose the majority of people
just want PDF annotations.
Might resurrect if there's a lot of requests for it.

2020-07-05 Sun

Link to the commit on pre-release and daily build pages.

Fixed a long-standing issue of loosing list of opened files
if Sumatra crashes or get killed by Windows (e.g. due to restart).
Took so long to fix becaue I believed the code is correct.
Turns out prefs::Save() was haphazardly used. It's still
not great but at least this specific error is fixed.
To be even more robust we should periodically (every 5 min?)
call prefs::Save(). We only do it after opening and closing a file,
which means that if we scroll etc., we'll loose this info.

Coding style refactorings: change enum SettingType to enum class,
change SerializeStruct() and SerializeGlobalPrefs() to return std::span<u8>.

Fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1661
Another example of broken PDF that can be better handled if we
relax parsing of PDF (cmap).

Fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/651
Managing focus is tricky.

Improving WStr the same way as Str, while we're in this area.

make ByteWriter manage it's own buffer. In retrospect it's
better API than passing a buffer.

2020-07-03 Fri

De-templetizing WStr implementation. Currently it's a subclass
of Vec<WCHAR>.
Yes, duplication of code is bad but so are templates.
Reading code where you see T instead of WCHAR is significantly
worse.
The more stuff there is in .h files, the more code uses
templates, the longer are compilation times.
Templated code must be in .h file. 
While I can't fix long compilation times, I can try to keep
them as fast as possible.
Also an opportunity to make the API smaller.

Optimized str::Str on 64-bit by changing type of len/cap from
size_t to u32.

---

Optimizing Str. Turns out that after de-templatizing the code
became easier to understand and opportunities for optimizations turn up.
The optimizations are pretty nasty (re-using the same memory for
more than one purpse) but worth doing for such a fundamental type.
