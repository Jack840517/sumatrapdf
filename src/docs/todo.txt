For 3.4 (a plan, not a promise):
* pdfprint
* change how translations work so that user can download latest translations
  even after the app has been released
  * when user switches a language and there are missing translations, download
    latest translations from apptranslator.org
  * if there are missing translations, ask the user to contribute
* running installer as admin should install to program files (so that it
  works for non-admin users). Maybe add -for-all cmd-line arg / checkbox

Done:
* remove unused code
* merge pre-release and daily builds (as pre-release builds)
* make updates of releases easier (instead of telling people to download the app
  from website, have them click and download / launch installer automatically)
* automatic updates for pre-release builds
* make it easy (one-click) to upgrade daily builds (all builds?)
* tooltip for tabs showing full path of the file
* merge TreeModel refactor
* switch most ebooks to use mupdf
